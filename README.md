<h1 align="center"> Experimental Design & Data Analysis Seminar </h1>

In this seminar, you can learn the basics, and more, of experimental design and data analysis. The seminar is structured to serve all types of linguists as we move from the analysis of continuous data on to models that support categorical data. In addition, it provides provide extensive explanations of the foundations of data types, data cleaning and experimental design. By the end of the seminar, attendees will be able to design, implement, and analyze their own experiment within any linguistic paradigm they desire!

This seminar was originally taught on 2021 at The Pennsylvania State University.

## 1. In the experimental design portion of the seminar, foundational concepts such as:
* Variable types
* Coding schemes (e.g., dummy coding)

* Couterbalancing

## 2. In the data analsis portion of the seminar, we first start by developing a data cleaning protocol:
(eye tracking data is used as an example)

In varied analyses are explained in full:
* Categorical outcome data analysis
* Continuous data analysis
* Linear Mixed Effecs Models
