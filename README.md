<h1 align="center"> Experimental Design & Data Analysis Seminar </h1>

This seminar serves as a guide of the basics of experimental design and data analysis. It is structured to serve all types of linguists as we move 
from the analysis of categorical data on to models that support continuous data. By the end of the seminar, you will be able to design, implement, and analyze your own experiment within any linguistic paradigm.

This seminar was originally taught on 2021 at The Pennsylvania State University.

## 1. In the experimental design portion of the seminar, foundational concepts such as:
* Variable types
* Coding schemes (e.g., dummy coding)

* Couterbalancing
* Randomizaton

## 2. In the data analsis portion of the seminar, we first start by developing a data cleaning protocol:
(eye tracking data is used as an example)

In varied analyses are explained in full:
* Categorical outcome data analysis
* Continuous data analysis
* Linear Mixed Effecs Models
